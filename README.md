# game engine with monogame framework
figure out the auto import module feature in omni and lsp


Going back to the old way of doing things where a collider is its own base class instead of a component... 

I don't need complicated collisions or many colliders I just need to have a ds that can collide with other colliders.


virtual maps are a grid that contains a grid that can contain any type of variable
